Banking Application in Java
This project is a simple console-based banking application implemented in Java. It allows users to manage a bank account with basic operations such as checking balances, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and viewing account details. This application is ideal for beginners looking to learn Java programming concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), conditional logic, and working with user input.

Features
Account Management:

Create a new account with an account holder's name, account number, and initial deposit.
Operations:

Check account balance.
Deposit funds.
Withdraw funds (with validation for sufficient balance).
Display account details.
Menu-Driven Interface:

Interactive menu to select operations.
Loop until the user decides to exit.
Validation:

Ensures deposit and withdrawal amounts are valid.
Prevents over-withdrawal.
Code Highlights
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

The Account class encapsulates account details and operations.
Methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and checkBalance() demonstrate encapsulation and abstraction.
Input Handling:

Uses Scanner for dynamic input from users.
Control Flow:

Implements a do-while loop and switch statement for user interaction.

Future Enhancements
Implement data persistence (e.g., save account details to a database or file).
Add user authentication for enhanced security.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
Support multiple accounts and transactions.
This repository is a great starting point for those learning Java and exploring the basics of OOP and interactive applications. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
